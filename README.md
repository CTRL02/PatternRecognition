# Pattern Recognition Project

This project focuses on pattern recognition using both regression and classification models. Various models were implemented to analyze different types of data, with each milestone documented separately.

## Project Overview

- Developed models to handle data requiring both regression and classification approaches.
- Each milestone is accompanied by a PDF detailing:
  - The work completed
  - Models used
  - Conclusions drawn from the analysis

## My Contributions

- Data analysis and exploration
- Detection and handling of outliers
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Data normalization to improve model accuracy
